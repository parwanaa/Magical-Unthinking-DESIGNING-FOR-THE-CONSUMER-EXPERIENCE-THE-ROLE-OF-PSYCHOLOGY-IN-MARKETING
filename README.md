Hello!


I'm pleased to have you on my Github page.


As part of our coursework for the Marketing Analytics course at WBS Coding School, my colleagues and I have created a comprehensive whitepaper that explores various psychological and design principles that can be utilized to boost conversion rates. 
The whitepaper offers a detailed explanation of the main principles and also provides examples of how they can be implemented in practice.
If you are interested in improving your marketing strategies, this whitepaper can be an invaluable resource for you. It offers insights into the critical relationship between marketing, psychology, and design and provides practical techniques that you can utilize to increase your conversion rates.


I hope you find it informative and useful in your endeavors.
